    <h2>Solar system</h2>
    <p>The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.<br><br>

        Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, 
        Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions 
        of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.<br><br>

        Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in night sky. So far, we have discovered thousands of 
        planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found all the time. Most of the hundreds 
        of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 
        billion galaxies in the universe.<br><br>

       While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company out there. It seems that we live 
       in a universe packed with planets — a web of countless stars accompanied by families of objects, perhaps some with life of their own.</p>

    <h2>Solar system Composition</h2>
   
   <p>The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates 
   it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn 
   together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, 
    asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.</p>

 <h3>Interplanetary Space</h3>
 <p>
       Nearly all the solar system by volume appears to be an empty void. Far from being nothingness, this vacuum of "space" 
       comprises the interplanetary medium. It includes various forms of energy and at least two material components: interplanetary 
      dust and interplanetary gas. Interplanetary dust consists of microscopic solid particles. Interplanetary gas is a tenuous flow 
      of gas and charged particles, mostly protons and electrons -- plasma -- which stream from the Sun, called the solar wind.<br><br>
   
      The solar wind can be measured by spacecraft, and it has a large effect on comet tails. It also has a measurable effect on the motion
      of spacecraft. The speed of the solar wind is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) per second in the vicinity of Earth's orbit. The point 
      at which the solar wind meets the interstellar medium, which is the "solar" wind from other stars, is called the heliopause. It is a boundary 
      theorized to be roughly circular or teardrop-shaped, marking the edge of the Sun's influence perhaps 100 AU from the Sun. The space within the 
      boundary of the heliopause, containing the Sun and solar system, is referred to as the heliosphere.<br><br>

     The solar magnetic field extends outward into interplanetary space; it can be measured on Earth and by spacecraft. 
     The solar magnetic field is the dominating magnetic field throughout the interplanetary regions of the solar system, 
     except in the immediate environment of planets which have their own magnetic fields.</p>

              <p>
                  The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),
                  which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System,produces temperatures and densities in its core high 
                enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This releases an enormous 
                amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.<br><br>

                The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate 
                 between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially 
                dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.<br><br>

                The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance) 
                than the older population II stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so 
                the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, 
                whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system 
                because the planets form from the accretion of "metals".</p>

     <p>A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, 
        is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.</p>

     <h3>Terrestrial Planets</h3>
     <img src="Terrestrial Planets.jpg" alt="Sun" width="30%" height="25%" style=" box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 3px black;">
     <p>A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. 
        Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. 
        The terms "terrestrial planet" and "telluric planet" are derived from Latin words for Earth (Terra and Tellus), as these planets 
        are, in terms of structure, Earth-like. These planets are located between the Sun and the asteroid belt.<br>

       Terrestrial planets have a solid planetary surface, making them substantially different from the larger gaseous planets, which are 
       composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical states.</p>
     </div>
     <div class=planetde>
     <h3>Jovian planets</h3>
     <img src="Jovian planets.jpg" alt="Sun" width="40%" height="30%" style=" box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 3px black;">
     <p>The giant planets of the outer solar system (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are often referred to as ‘Jovian planets’. 
        This term literally means Jupiter-like, and although exploration of the Solar System over the past few decades has revealed that 
        Uranus and Neptune in particular bear little resemblance to Jupiter (they are better described as ‘ice giants’), the name persists. 
        It is often used to contrast these massive planets with the inner Earth-like or terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.
        The term ‘Jovian’ is also now commonly used in the study of extrasolar planets to describe the Jupiter-mass planets found in these systems.</p>
     </div>
     <div class=planetde>
     <h3>Dwarf planets</h3>
     <img src="Dwarf planets.jpg" alt="Sun" width="30%" height="25%" style=" box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 3px black;">
     <p>A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that does not dominate its region of space (as a true or classical planet does) 
        and is not a satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of the Sun and is massive enough to be plastic – for its gravity to 
        maintain it in a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid) – but has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other material.
        The prototype dwarf planet is Pluto.</p>

<div class="AsteriodBelt">
    <h2>Asteriod Belt</h2>
    
     <img src="AsteriodBeltivedio.gif" alt="Sun" width="50%" height="50%" style="display:block; box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 3px black; margin:auto;">
           
    <p>The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the orbits of the planets Jupiter 
       and Mars, that is occupied by a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies, of many sizes but much smaller than planets, 
       called asteroids or minor planets. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it 
       from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.<br><br>

       About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass 
       of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon 
       Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).</p>

<div class="KuiperBelt">
    <h2>Kuiper Belt</h2>
    
     <img src="kuiper-belt.png" alt="Sun" width="40%" height="30%" style="display:block; box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px 3px black; ">
           
    <p class="kp">The Kuiper Belt (also known as the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt) is a region of the Solar System that exists beyond the eight major
       planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. It is similar to the asteroid belt,
       in that it contains many small bodies, all remnants from the Solar System’s formation.<br><br>

       The Kuiper Belt is a collection of bodies outside the orbit of Neptune that, if nothing else had happened, if Neptune hadn’t 
       formed or if things had gone a little bit better, maybe they could have gotten together themselves and formed the next planet 
       out beyond Neptune. But instead, in the history of the solar system, when Neptune formed it led to these objects not being able 
       to get together, so it’s just this belt of material out beyond Neptune.</p>

    <p>Comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system composed of dust, rock and ices. They range from a 
       few miles to tens of miles wide, but as they orbit closer to the sun, they heat up and spew gases and dust into a glowing head that
       can be larger than a planet. This material forms a tail that stretches millions of miles.<br><br>

       Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that orbit the Sun. When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When 
       a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. 
       The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our 
       Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.</p>
